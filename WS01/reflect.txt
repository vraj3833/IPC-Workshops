Answer1;- I have learned many things from this workshop like writing my first code using C language. The second important thing which i have learnt is about using matrix, at first it was very challenging but after doing this workshop matrix became very easy for me. Also, I have learned different software's like filezilla and putty. Lastly, i would say that i have learned about the academic integrity that how the violation of that can lead you to some serious circumstances. 

Answer2;- SSH or secure shell is a medium by which a local machine can access the remote host. SSH is like a bridge between local machine and remote machine by which they can communicate securely. I have used SSH to communicate with seneca's Matrix remote linux server.

Answer3;- SFTP is a secure way or method, which is generally used to transfer data between two computers securely. I will also submit my week1 workshop by it.
